    <h1>My Favorite Poems</h1>

<p>The Rose that Grew from the Concrete. Did you hear about the rose that grew
    from a crack in the concrete?
    Proving nature's law is wrong it
    learned to walk with out having feet.
    Funny it seems, but by keeping its dreams,
    it learned to breathe fresh air.
    Long live the rose that grew from concrete
    when no one else ever cared.</p>
