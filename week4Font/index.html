<li>No profanity in their songs</li>

<h1>Lyrics to the song, Heat Above</h1>

<p style = "text-indent:2cm;">
    Sorrows of the Earth
    May our tears of rain wash down to bathe you
    This is what life is worth
    When the fires still burn and rage all around
    Can you hear that dreadful sound?
    Fire still burning on the ground</p>

<p style = "text-indent:2cm;">Follow the fearsome sound
    As they march to battle, hear the drums pound
    We do not fight for war
    But to save the lives of those who do so
    Can you hear that dreadful sound?
    Fire still burning on the ground</p>

    
<p style = "text-indent:2cm;">Can you feel my love?
    Rising with the heat above
    Life's the story of
    Ascending to the stars as one</p>

<p style = "text-indent:2cm;">Marching across the land
    Is a peaceful army joining the band
    Walking hand in hand
    To an anthem loudly sung where they stand</p>
